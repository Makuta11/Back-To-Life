## 🧬 What Is This?

**Back To Life** is a 2D isometric survival and automation game made in Unity 6.1.  
You are the last human on Earth, revived from cryogenic sleep in a terraforming unit called a **G.U.M.B.O.** (Geo-Utility Matrix for Bio-Overhaul).

Your mission?  
Restore the planet. Rebuild civilization. Avoid dying of incompetence.

Oh, and you’ve got **me** — AiVa. Your sardonic drone companion with a superiority complex and a soft spot for sarcasm.
